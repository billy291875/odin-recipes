    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I suppose since I have recipes for <em>Skillet Lasagna</em>, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.</p>
    <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, <strong>savory meat sauce</strong>, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ricotta cheese mixture in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
    </ol>
